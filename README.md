ross-platform Asset Bundle/Serialized File reader and writer. Originally based on (but not a fork of) UABE.

Extracting assets
I develop UABEA as more of a modding/research tool than an extracting tool. Use AssetRipper or AssetStudio if you only want to extract assets.

Addressables
Many games are also now using addressables. You can tell if the bundle you're opening is part of addressables because it has the path StreamingAssets/aa/XXX/something.bundle. If you want to edit these bundles, you will need to clear the CRC checks with the CRC cleaning tool here. Use Example patchcrc catalog.json, then move or rename the old catalog.json file and rename catalog.json.patched to catalog.json.
